Ambari server is by and large a state driven system. EasyMock can be used to bypass the state changes and test components narrowly. However, it is probably better to rather use in-memory database to simulate state changes and use EasyMock only when certain behavior cannot be easily simulated.

It can be tested by mocking the action manager object, alternatively, it can be tested by setting the state in the in-memory database. In this case, the later is a more comprehensive test.\nAvoid static methods and objects, Easymock cannot mock these.
