## Installation and Setup

### What are the system requirements for Ambari 3.0.0?

For a development environment using Vagrant:
- Host CPU: 6+ cores (2 cores per VM)
- Host RAM: 24GB+ (8GB per VM)
- Storage: 100GB+ free space
- VirtualBox 6.1+ and Vagrant 2.2+

For production environments, requirements will vary based on cluster size and workload.

### Which operating systems are supported?

Ambari 3.0.0 supports:
- Rocky Linux 8
- CentOS 7
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8
- Ubuntu 18.04 and 20.04

### How do I enable the Rocky-Devel repository?

You need to edit the Rocky-Devel.repo file on each VM. You may encounter two scenarios:
1. All lines commented out: Uncomment the necessary lines
2. Repository disabled with enabled=0: Change to enabled=1

To verify the repository is properly enabled, run:
```bash
yum repolist | grep devel
```

### How do I troubleshoot SSH connectivity issues?

If you're experiencing SSH connectivity issues:
1. Verify SSH service is running: `systemctl status sshd`
2. Check SSH configuration: `cat /etc/ssh/sshd_config` (ensure PasswordAuthentication and PermitRootLogin are set to yes)
3. Restart SSH service: `systemctl restart sshd`
4. Redistribute SSH keys if needed: `ssh-copy-id -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no user@host`

## Configuration

### How do I disable SELinux?

To temporarily disable SELinux:
```bash
setenforce 0
```

To permanently disable SELinux, edit `/etc/selinux/config` and set:
```
SELINUX=disabled
```

### How do I configure the hosts file correctly?

Ensure your hosts file:
1. Does not contain loopback entries for your cluster hostnames
2. Contains proper static IP mappings for all nodes
3. Is consistent across all nodes in the cluster

For example:
```
192.168.56.20 vm1
192.168.56.21 vm2
192.168.56.22 vm3
```

### Which database systems are supported?

Ambari 3.0.0 supports:
- PostgreSQL 9.6+
- MySQL 5.7+
- MariaDB 10.2+
- OceanBase

## Troubleshooting

### Common installation issues

1. **Repository access problems**:
   - Verify internet connectivity
   - Check repository configuration
   - Ensure Rocky-Devel repository is enabled

2. **Database connection issues**:
   - Verify database service is running
   - Check connection string and credentials
   - Ensure database user has proper permissions

3. **Agent registration failures**:
   - Verify hostname resolution works in both directions
   - Check firewall settings
   - Ensure time is synchronized across all nodes
